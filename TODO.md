## Presmedia To Do

I decided the UI was getting nasty, so I've simplified it considerably.  Instead of building up
custom filter graphs, you'll have some reasonable presets (reasonable for me, anyway)
that you can choose from.  If there's demand, I'll make the presets configurable, 
but for now, minimum viable product reigns supreme.
